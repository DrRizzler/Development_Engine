# Development_BaseEngine
Minimal C++ engine base using **SFML 3** for window/input and **OpenGL (via GLAD)** for rendering.

(Intention is longterm will work on all OS)


File struct: ~/dev/engine
            (I'm not posting the SFML libs but I have them in the /dev directory - I'll post a tree later)
